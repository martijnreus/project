# Get set with GitHub

From now on, we will work with GitHub to keep track of changes within our project's code.


# 1. Create a GitHub account if you havent
- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com). You will also use it for the rest of the minor programming.

# 2. Add your GitHub account to Xcode
- Open Xcode and go to preferences

- Enter your username and the personal token. If you haven't registered to "GitHub" before, you may be asked to create a personal access token to verify your account. You can make use of the "Create a Token on GitHub" button to get redirected to GitHub. Make sure to save your personal access token somewhere on your computer (and not in a textfile within in your GitHub repository) and select all scopes.
