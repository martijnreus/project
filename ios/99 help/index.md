#### Closures

Closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code. Closures in Swift are similar to blocks in C and Objective-C and to lambdas in other programming languages.

#### Ternary Conditional Operator

The ternary conditional operator is a shortcut for conditional statement constructions. Besides Swift, it can also be used in C, Python, JavaScript and other programming languages.
