## Practical Tips & Tricks

#### Closures

Closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code. Closures in Swift are similar to blocks in C and Objective-C and to lambdas in other programming languages.

#### Ternary Conditional Operator

The ternary conditional operator is a shortcut for conditional statement constructions. Besides Swift, it can also be used in C, Python, JavaScript and other programming languages.

#### Why can't I see a preview of my code?
Only SwiftUI files show a preview on the canvas.

#### Why can't I see my canvas in a SwiftUI file?
You can toggle seeing your canvas with command + option + enter.

#### I just declared or changed some variabes that my compiler doesn't seem to recognize?
Try to _clean build_ with command + shift + k.
