# Setting up your development environment

For iOS app development, we have to work in Xcode. Xcode is the integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Apple, specifically for the development of applications for Apple devices. 

Start with installing Xcode 15 in the App Store of your MacBook. You can also follow this [link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12/).

> Make sure you are connected to the `eduroam` or `uva` WiFi network. Downloading Xcode via `Amsterdam Science Park` will take a very long time and is not recommended! If you need help fixing your `eduroam` connection, we highly recommend going to the [uva laptophelpdesk](https://student.uva.nl/onderwerpen/laptopondersteuning) to fix this.

While it is downloading, start reading about [Swift](/ios/10 swift/index.md)
