Create a TODO application with several views using Swift and Swift UI.

## Getting started

- Start a new Xcode SwiftUI project, while saving make sure you select _Create Git repository on My Mac_.
- Accept this GitHub Classroom invite.
- Go to the repository and copy the link you'll see just below _Quick setup_.
- In the menu bar, click _Editor_ then _Add Existing Remoteâ€¦_ and paste the link you just copied in the _Location_ field.

### Minimal functional requirements
