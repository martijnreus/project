# Swift UI

Now that we have been introducted to the basics of Swift let's put them into practice! To build our first app we also need SwiftUI and Xcode.

Apple provides very clear in-depth tutorials on how to develop apps in Xcode. Your first task will be to follow the full [SwiftUI Essentials Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views). 

This tutorial consists of the three parts:

1. Creating and Combining Views
2. Building lists and navigations (apart from section 8*)
3. Handling user input

Once you're done with this, you have built your first iOS app.

*For the scope of this project we are focusing on iOS development for iPhones so we can skip this.
