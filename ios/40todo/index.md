## Getting started

- Start a new Xcode SwiftUI project, while saving make sure you select _Create Git repository on My Mac_.
- Accept [this GitHub Classroom invite](https://classroom.github.com/a/9O2ynG8n) and copy the link to your own repository (it should look like https://github.com/minprog-platforms/ios-todo-app-<your name>).
- Make sure to link your Xcode project to the GitHub Classroom Repository as indicated on the [GitHub Page](/ios/30github/index.md)


### Minimal functional requirements
