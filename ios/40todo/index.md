# TODO

Create a todo application with several views using Swift and Swift UI. 
 

## Getting started

- Start a new Xcode SwiftUI project, while saving make sure you select _Create Git repository on My Mac_.
- Accept [this GitHub Classroom invite](https://classroom.github.com/a/CPtSIJ_B) and copy the link to your own repository (it should look like https://github.com/minprog-platforms/ios-todo-app-(USERNAME)).
- Make sure to link your Xcode project to the GitHub Classroom Repository as indicated on the [GitHub Page](/ios/30github/index.md)


### Minimal functional requirements

- Supports adding a new todo entry
- Supports clicking that todo entry is done
- Supports removing a todo entry

### Optional features

- Supports modifying a todo entry
- Filtering to only show tasks that aren't completed
- What else you would like for a todo app
- Saves todo entries, even when the app is closed and reopened

### Technical requirements

* The application should run and at no moment crash.
* The application should be written in Swift and SwiftUI, no UIKit, C or Objective-C is allowed.

## Inspiration

Your application could look somewhat like the images below, but you are free to invent your own design if you like. Just make sure, your application works as desired in the end.

## Steps

### Create views using SwiftUI
Start by creating a new SwiftUI app. Then go ahead and lay the foundations for the todo-app itself. 

### Tips
Consider the components a todo-app consists of (such as the listed tasks); You may need to create separate views for those. For the start it is totally fine to hardcode a few items within the todo-list. Once the views are created and the basic functionality is working, try to make the todo-list dynamic. 


### Schedule
Try to finish at least all views by tuesday 7 november.
